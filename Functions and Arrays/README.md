# 🌟 Practice Questions on Functions & Array Methods 🌟

Welcome to the practice questions repository! 🎉  
This section will help you level up your skills in **functions** and **array methods** like `forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`. Let’s code smart! 💡🧠

---

## 📌 Question 1: **Count vowels in a string**

🔤 Create a function using the `function` keyword that:

- Takes a **string** as an argument  
- Returns the **number of vowels** in the string<br>

💡 **Hint**: Vowels are `a, e, i, o, u` (both lowercase and uppercase). Loop through the string and count them.

## 📌 Question 2: **Print square of each number**

🧮 Given an array of numbers, print the **square of each value** using the `forEach()` loop.

let numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5];
💡 Hint: Use forEach() to iterate and console.log(num * num).

## 📌 Question 3: **Filter marks & reduce to product**
🎓 Given an array of marks, do the following:


let marks = [95, 67, 89, 90, 76, 93];
🧪 Filter marks of students that scored 90+

✖️ Use reduce() to calculate the product of all numbers in the array

💡 Hint: First use filter(), then reduce() on the result.

## 📌 Question 4: **Create array from 1 to n and reduce sum**
🔢 Take a number n as input from the user.

Create an array from 1 to n

Use reduce() to calculate the sum of all numbers

💡 Hint: Use a loop or Array.from() to create the array, then apply reduce().
