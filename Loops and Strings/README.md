# 🌟 Practice Questions on Loops and Strings 🌟

Welcome to the practice questions repository! 🎉  
Here, you'll find exercises to strengthen your understanding of **loops** and **string manipulation** in JavaScript. Let's get coding! 💻✨

---

## 📌 Question 1: **Print all even numbers from 0 to 100**

🔢 Use a loop to print all even numbers between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

💡 **Hint**: Use a `for` loop and check if a number is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator `%`.

---

## 📌 Question 2: **Guess the game number until correct**

🎮 Create a number guessing game:

- Start with any random number as the **game number**.
- Prompt the user repeatedly to guess the number using `prompt()`.
- Keep asking until the user guesses correctly.
- Once correct, print `"You guessed it right!"`.

💡 **Hint**: Use a `while` loop and compare the user's input with the game number.

## 📌 Question 3: **Generate username from full name**

🧑‍💻 Prompt the user to enter their full name.

- Create a username in the format: `@fullname<length of name>`
- Example: If input is `"shradhakhapra"`, output should be `"@shradhakhapra13"`

💡 **Hint**: Use `prompt()` to get input, and combine strings with `.length` to get the final username.
